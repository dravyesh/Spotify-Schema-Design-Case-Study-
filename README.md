# Spotify-Schema-Design-Case-Study-

This project is a case study on Spotify, focusing on dissecting its core features and designing a relational database schema. The schema models users, playlists, tracks, artists, albums, and interactions, capturing essential relationships such as user-playlist, playlist-track, track-artist, and track-album.

The project demonstrates data modeling, relational database design, and understanding platform workflows. Key skills applied include identifying entities and attributes, defining primary and foreign keys, and mapping relationships.

A visual ER diagram illustrates the database structure and how Spotify’s functionality, including playlist management, music streaming, and user interactions, is represented.
